# Title
Presence of unused variables

## Relationships
[CWE-1164: Irrelevant Code](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1164.html)

## Description
While unused variables are allowed by Solidity, they still should be avoided due to redundant increase of computations (and unnecessary gas consumption). In most cases, they are result of inattentiveness, which leads to an increased code complexity.

Each unused variable:
* indicates possibility of code malformed structure;
* causes code noise and complicates readability of code;
* leads to redundant computations (and unnecessary gas consumption).

## Remediation
Remove unused variables or use them and always check for compiler warnings as they can indicate such variables.
