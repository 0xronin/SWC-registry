# Title 
Incorrect Constructor Name 

## Relationships
[CWE-665: Improper Initialization](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/665.html)

## Description 
Constructors are special functions, which can only be called only once during the contract creation. They often perform critical, privileged for instance setting the owner of the contract. Before Solidity version 0.4.22 constructors are defined as functions that had have the same name as the contract that contains them. Thus, when a contract name gets changed in development, if the constructor name isn't changed, it becomes a normal, callable function. 

## Remediation

Solidity version 0.4.22 introduces a new `constructor` keyword that make a contructor definitions clearer. It is therefore recommended to upgrade the contract to a recent version of the Solidity compiler and change to the new contructor declaration.
