# Title
Signature Malleability

## Base/Class ID
[Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/347.html)

## Description
The implementation of a cryptographic signature system in Ethereum contracts often assumes that the signature is unique, but signatures can be altered by any party and still be valid. The cryptographic signature system used by the Ethereum network is ECDSA and it generates an output (r, s) (note that in the Ethereum network the signature includes a v which specifies the x coordinate of the point). However the signature (r ,-s mod n), where n is the order of the elliptic curve, is still a valid signature in the ECDSA protocol. So any protocol which accepts signatures must not just disqualify a signature to avoid a replay attack.

## Remediation
In a system which has users sign a transaction like hash(nonce, to, from, value) the system should not track the transactions made using the signature. Instead they should track transactions based on the hash of the transaction data.
