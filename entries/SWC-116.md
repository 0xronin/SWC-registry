# Title 
Timestamp Dependence

## Relationships
[CWE-829: Inclusion of Functionality from Untrusted Control Sphere](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/829.html)

## Description 

Contracts often need an access to the current timestamp to trigger time-dependent events. As Ethereum is decentralized, nodes can syncronize time only to some degree. Moreover, malicious miners can alter the timestamp of their blocks, especially if they can receive any benefits by doing so. However, miners can't set timestamp smaller than the previous one (otherwise the block will be rejected), nor they can set timestamp too much in the future (otherwise they will lose peers and will be disconnected from the network).

Taking all of the above into consideration, developers can't rely on the preciseness of the provided timestamp, though it's safe to say that it'll not differ by more than a few minutes.

## Remediation

Developers should write smart contracts with the notion that block timestamp and real timestamp may vary by a few seconds. Alternatively, they can use block number or external source of timestamp via oracles.
