# Title 
Unprotected Ether Withdrawal

## Base/Class Type
[CWE-284: Improper Access Control](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/284.html)

## Description 

Due to missing or insufficient access controls, malicious parties can withdraw some or all Ether from the contract account.

This bug is sometimes caused by unintentionally exposing initialization functions. By wrongly naming a function intended to be a constructor, the constructor code ends up in the runtime bytecode and can be called by anyone to re-initialize the contract.
